My name is Aaron Dalton. I have a BA (Hon.) and an MA in musicology from the University of Calgary. My area of focus was sixteenth-century Italian secular vocal music. I can speak, read, and write English, French, and Italian. More information on my academic work can be found on [my Academia.edu page](http://ucalgary.academia.edu/AaronDalton). I also discuss my thesis on [my master’s thesis page](http://perlkonig.com/about/masters-thesis/).

I am a professional editor and typesetter with expertise in music editing and typesetting.
